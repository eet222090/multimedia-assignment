huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. the idea is to assign variable length codes to input characters lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters.
the variable length codes assigned to input characters are prefix codes means the codes bit sequences are assigned in such a way that the code assigned to one character is not the prefix of code assigned to any other character. this is how huffman coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream.
let us understand prefix codes with a counter example.
